                <h1>About You</h1>
                <p>Nah this is so corny but nice picture am I right? I would've selected a better one but somebody was too reluctant to send any. 
                    Since this is an about you section I suppose I'll write down things I remember of you. 
                    Chick-fil-a of course. You stand at an astounding 5 foot 8 inches, so you come up short when it comes to being taller than I am. 
                    You actually dress like a hillbilly but in a softer sense, so white girl? But don't worry we'll fix that soon enough.
                     You share a shockingly similar music taste to me, so you have a music taste that is 98 percent perfect :). 
                     You're a genuine and warm-hearted person who is pretty fun to be around-- taken from a sample space of one day so not completely accurate. 
                     Okay not enough space to fit anything else you're pretty cool I guess.
